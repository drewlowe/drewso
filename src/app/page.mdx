### Here's where I'm coming from...

I've been building for as long as I can remember. Most of the things I've ever built have faded from memory. What little success I've had so far stands on the back of seemingly endless failures. People who meet me today only see the technical skill and the business acumen. They don't see the years of stupid mistakes and wasted potential.

When I was about 6 years old, I started building my first sites on Blogger and then basic HTML and CSS. When I saw *The Social Network* at 13 years old, I believed that I could build anything.

Unfortunately, I was 13 and life began to get difficult at home. As a nerdy kid, I became more concerned with social acceptance than software. Instead of honing my craft, I wasted my teenage years chasing social acceptance—a losing game.

In [the Paul Graham model](https://www.paulgraham.com/nerds.html), I was a nerd who wanted to be popular. A nerd who wanted to be loved. And that turns you into a freak.

My path was not that of the Ivy League savant who would beeline from Harvard to Facebook. By 19, I had dropped out of college to pursue music, not because I loved it, but because I wanted the illusion of significance. This led me to the darkest years of my life.

That darkness taught me the most important lesson I've ever learned: **ego and illusion lead nowhere**.

Naval Ravikant said, 'The fundamental delusion: There is something out there that will make me happy and fulfilled forever.' I lived in that delusion for years. But as Proust reminds us, time lost can still be reclaimed—if you have the discipline to search for it.

Finally, I learned to trade the delusion of tomorrow for the discipline of today. In just the past few years of relentless work, I have begun to take back the lost time:

- Closed 8-figures worth of tech contracts
- Learned more technologies than I thought possible
- Turned trauma into a source of strength

I know this is not a traditional developer bio. But I'm not a traditional developer. I'm a developer who has been through the fire and come out the other side. I bring an opinionated perspective because software is not merely "the encoding of human thought." **It is the encoding of human spirit**.

This is what inspires my work today in blockchain development. When I mined my first few satoshis as a teenager, I was just in it for a quick thrill. Now, I value the primitives of blockchain as a way to build a better world.

Blockchain is a paradox: the most permanent digital system ever built, created in a world where nothing lasts. In a world obsessed with short-term dopamine, permanence feels radical.

The Facebook era of the Internet has traded the Buddhist wisdom of impermanence for the rat-race of the endless scroll. No longer is impermanence imbued with the vibrancy of the present moment, it is the anxiety of the next dopamine hit.

I believe that blockchain can bring us back to the present moment. By embedding immutability into the fabric of the Internet, we can bring intentionality back to our digital lives.

Eventually, even the immutable contributions we make to blockchains today will be forgotten. Whether Ethereum is replaced by a more ubiquitous blockchain, nuclear winter wipes out the Internet, or the heat death of the universe erases all memory of our existence, the only thing that will remain is the present moment.

But yet blockchain's long-term semi-permanence can be a source of hope. It is the hope that what we build today is not just for the next quarterly earnings report or TikTok FYP, but for the next generation. It is the hope that we can build networks where value is a public good.

This is where I'm coming from. This is why I build.
